# pay-connector
The GOV.UK Pay Connector in Java (Dropwizard)


## Environment Variables

| Varible | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `AUTH_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `10 seconds` | the timeout before the resource responds with an awaited auth response (202), so that frontend can choose to show a spinner and poll for auth response. Supports any duration parsable by dropwizard [Duration](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/master/dropwizard-util/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/util/Duration.java)|
| `SECURE_WORLDPAY_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED` | false | whether to filter incoming notifications by domain; they will be rejected with a 403 unless they match the required domain |
| `SECURE_WORLDPAY_NOTIFICATION_DOMAIN` | `worldpay.com` | incoming requests will have a reverse DNS lookup done on their domain. They must resolve to a domain with this suffix (see `DnsUtils.ipMatchesDomain()`) |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENABLED` | false | Whether confirmation emails will be sent using GOV.UK Notify |
| `NOTIFY_PAYMENT_RECEIPT_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID` | - | ID of the email template specified in the GOV.UK Notify to be used for sending emails. An email template can accept personalisation (placeholder values which are passed in by the code). |
| `NOTIFY_API_KEY` | - | API Key for the account created at GOV.UK Notify |
| `NOTIFY_BASE_URL` | `https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk` | Base URL of GOV.UK Notify API to be used|
| `GDS_CONNECTOR_WORLDPAY_TEST_URL` | - | Pointing to the TEST gateway URL of Worldpay payment provider. |
| `GDS_CONNECTOR_WORLDPAY_LIVE_URL` | - | Pointing to the LIVE gateway URL of Worldpay payment provider. |
| `GDS_CONNECTOR_SMARTPAY_TEST_URL` | - | Pointing to the TEST gateway URL of Smartpay payment provider. |
| `GDS_CONNECTOR_SMARTPAY_LIVE_URL` | - | Pointing to the LIVE gateway URL of Smartpay payment provider. |
| `GDS_CONNECTOR_EPDQ_TEST_URL` | - | Pointing to the TEST gateway URL of ePDQ payment provider. |
| `GDS_CONNECTOR_EPDQ_LIVE_URL` | - | Pointing to the LIVE gateway URL of ePDQ payment provider. |
| `ASYNCHRONOUS_CAPTURE` | true | whether to handle capture asynchronously. When asynchronous capture is enabled, capture requests are deferred and operated in batch by a background task  |
| `CAPTURE_USING_SQS_FEATURE_FLAG` | false | Enable or disable capturing charges using SQS as capture queue  |
| `COLLECT_FEE_FEATURE_FLAG` | false | enable or disable collecting fees for the Stripe payment gateway. |
| `STRIPE_TRANSACTION_FEE_PERCENTAGE` | - | percentage of total charge amount to recover GOV.UK Pay platform costs. |
| `STRIPE_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_ID` | - | the account ID for the Stripe Connect GOV.UK Pay platform. |


### Queues
| Varible | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `AWS_SQS_REGION`            | - | SQS capture queue region |
| `AWS_SQS_CAPTURE_QUEUE_URL` | - | SQS capture queue URL  |
| `AWS_SQS_NON_STANDARD_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`  | false | Set to true to use non standard (eg: http://my-own-sqs-endpoint) SQS endpoint |
| `AWS_SQS_ENDPOINT`          | - |  URL that is the entry point for SQS. Only required when AWS_SQS_NON_STANDARD_SERVICE_ENDPOINT is `true` |
| `AWS_SECRET_KEY`            | - | Secret key. Only required when AWS_SQS_NON_STANDARD_SERVICE_ENDPOINT is `true` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`            | - | Access key. Only required when AWS_SQS_NON_STANDARD_SERVICE_ENDPOINT is `true`|

### Background captures

The background capture mechanism will capture all payments in the `CAPTURE_APPROVED` state.

A background thread managed by dropwizard runs on all connector nodes. It polls the database periodically to check for payments which need to be captured.

The polling interval is a random value between 150-200 seconds.

If a capture attempt fails it will be retried again after a specified delay (`CAPTURE_PROCESS_RETRY_FAILURES_EVERY`).

The following variables control the background process:

| Varible | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `BACKGROUND_PROCESSING_ENABLED` | `true` | enables registering scheduled processes - it includes both database based & queue based capture methods |
| `CAPTURE_PROCESS_BATCH_SIZE` | `10` | limits the batch window size processed at each polling attempt. If connector is not managing to clear the queue of captures, increase this value. |
| `CAPTURE_PROCESS_RETRY_FAILURES_EVERY` | `60 minutes` | a failed capture attempt will be returned to the queue, and will not be retried until this time has passed |
| `CAPTURE_PROCESS_MAXIMUM_RETRIES` | `48` | connector keeps track of the number of times capture has been attempted for each charge. If a charge fails this number of times or more it will be marked as a permanent failure. An error log message will be written as well. This should *never* happen and if it does it should be investigated. |

## Integration tests

To run the integration tests, the `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variables must be set up correctly. On OS X the environment can be set up with:


## Contract tests

`$GDS_CONNECTOR_WORLDPAY_PASSWORD` and`$GDS_CONNECTOR_WORLDPAY_PASSWORD` environment variable must be set for Worldpay contract tests.
`GDS_CONNECTOR_SMARTPAY_USER`, `GDS_CONNECTOR_SMARTPAY_PASSWORD` must be set for the smartpay contract tests.

```
    eval $(boot2docker shellinit)
    eval $(docker-machine env <virtual-machine-name>)

```

The command to run all the tests is:

```
    mvn verify
```

### Command line tasks

There are a number of
[commands](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.1.0/docs/manual/core.html#commands)
which can run from the command line. Invoke the all-in-one jar to see a list
of the commands:

```
$ java -jar target/pay-connector-0.1-SNAPSHOT-allinone.jar
```

* `waitOnDependencies [-h] [file]` - Waits for dependent resources to become available

   positional arguments: `file` - application configuration file

* `render-state-transition-graph` - Outputs a representation of the connector state
                                    transitions as a graphviz 'dot' file
